Fix the issue where the demo version of FlowOps shows all tabs, inventory, equipment, tasks, menus, and all features correctly, but the published version does not show them.
This happens because the demo/preview environment and the published environment are currently using different databases, or the published environment is missing the schema, data, or permissions needed for these screens.
You must resolve this.

Apply the following fixes:

⸻

🔧 1. THE PUBLISHED VERSION MUST USE THE SAME DATABASE STRUCTURE AS THE PREVIEW VERSION

If the system cannot automatically migrate or copy the DB structure from preview to production:

✔️ Revert to a previous checkpoint where published version DID show inventory and all tabs properly.

✔️ Copy the working database schema and logic from that checkpoint.

Then:

✔️ Merge the newest changes (Admin role, approvals, profile, user roles, notifications) into that working baseline.

The final published version must:
	•	Show all tabs
	•	Show inventory items
	•	Show equipment items
	•	Allow adding new items
	•	Show menu & portion sizes
	•	Show checklists & tasks
	•	Use the same display and logic as the demo

⸻

🔁 2. IF MIGRATION FAILS, CLONE & PASTE THE WORKING CODE FROM THE CHECKPOINT

If the AI cannot sync the DB:

✔️ Go to the last checkpoint where the published version successfully showed all tabs and inventory

✔️ Copy the full functional logic from that checkpoint

✔️ Paste/merge that logic into the current build

✔️ Then reapply the recent improvements:
	•	Admin account and permissions
	•	Manager approval flow
	•	Role assignment
	•	Inventory add button
	•	Equipment add button
	•	Menu item add button
	•	Bug fixes

Do NOT overwrite the Admin account or the new user-approval system.

🗃 3. ENSURE PUBLISHED BUILD HAS ACCESS TO ALL TABLES & COLLECTIONS

The published version must have:
	•	Inventory table
	•	Equipment table
	•	Menu items + portions
	•	Weekly tasks
	•	Checklists
	•	Users
	•	Roles
	•	Approvals
	•	Pending users

If the published DB is missing these tables:

👉 Create or sync them from the preview DB automatically.

⸻

🔒 4. FIX PERMISSIONS SO THE ADMIN CAN SEE THE PUBLISHED DATA

Ensure the published app does NOT filter out data for Admin users.

Admin must see:
	•	All inventory
	•	All tasks
	•	All equipment
	•	All menu items
	•	All users
	•	All establishments

If the published version hides the tabs from Admin because of incorrect role filters:

👉 Fix role logic so Admin = full access everywhere.

⸻

🧱 5. ENSURE PUBLISHED VERSION USES THE SAME UI COMPONENTS

If published app references components or screens missing from production:

👉 Copy screens & components from the working checkpoint.

This includes:
	•	Inventory screen
	•	Equipment screen
	•	Menu & Sizes
	•	Tasks
	•	Checklists
	•	Profile
	•	Employee Management
	•	Pending Users screen

Everything must be present in the published build.

⸻

🔁 6. FINAL REQUIREMENT

The published version must behave identical to the demo version.

If syncing fails:

👉 Restore the system to the last working checkpoint
👉 Insert all new features on top
👉 Re-deploy with all admin functionality preserved

⸻

✔️ END OF PROMPT
