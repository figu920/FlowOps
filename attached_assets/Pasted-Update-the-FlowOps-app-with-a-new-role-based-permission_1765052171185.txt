Update the FlowOps app with a new role-based permission system and improved inventory/equipment functionality.
The app must now support 3 user types with different levels of access: Manager, Lead, and Employee.

👤 1. USER ROLES AND PERMISSIONS
Employee (Basic User)

Can view inventory

Can update item status (OK / LOW / OUT)

When selecting LOW, must enter a short comment such as “15% left”, “almost empty”, etc.

Can report equipment issues (Working / Needs Attention / Broken)

Cannot add or delete inventory items

Cannot add or delete equipment items

Cannot edit names, photos, or categories

Employee Lead (Intermediate Role — Manager-Approved)

Employee Leads should have all employee permissions, plus:

Can add new inventory items

Can upload photos for each new inventory item

Can add new equipment items

Can upload photos for each new equipment item

Can modify item categories

Can edit names of inventory/equipment items

Can NOT delete items permanently (only managers may delete)

Lead users must see the “+” button on both:

Inventory screen

Equipment screen

Employees should NOT see the “+” button.

Manager (Full Access)

Managers have all permissions, including:

Add inventory items

Edit inventory items

Delete inventory items

Add equipment items

Edit and delete equipment items

Approve or remove Employee Leads

View all LOW comments and timestamps

Access full timeline logs

Managers always see the “+” button in Inventory and Equipment.

📦 2. INVENTORY UPDATES

Modify the Inventory screen so that:

✔ Managers and Leads see a + button (top right)

When tapped, show a form:

ADD INVENTORY ITEM FORM:

Item Name

Category (optional)

Upload Photo/Icon

Save

Once saved, the new item appears instantly with OK/LOW/OUT buttons.

✔ LOW status must include a comment box

Whenever LOW is selected:

“How much is left approximately?”
[ short text input ]
[ Save ]

Then automatically:

Log comment + timestamp

Add to Timeline

Make visible to managers and leads

🔧 3. EQUIPMENT UPDATES

Modify the Equipment screen exactly the same way:

✔ Managers and Leads see a “+” button (top right)

ADD EQUIPMENT FORM:

Equipment Name

Upload Photo/Icon

Category (optional)

Save

New equipment items appear with statuses:

Working (Green)

Needs Attention (Yellow)

Broken (Red)

Employees cannot add new equipment.

🕒 4. ROLE ACCESS LOGIC

Employee Leads can only be created or approved by Managers.

App must hide or show buttons based on role:

Employees: no + button, no edit options

Leads: + button + edit options (no delete)

Managers: full access including delete

💾 5. DATA LOGGING REQUIREMENTS

For every action (LOW, OUT, Broken, Completed Task, New Item, etc.):

Save user role

Save username

Save timestamp

Save comment (if provided)

Add entry to Timeline
