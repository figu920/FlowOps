Fix the current app behavior so that the Admin role has full functional access to all features.
Right now, the Admin cannot see any tasks, inventory, checklists, or menu items, and cannot approve newly registered users.
This must be corrected immediately.

Apply the following fixes:
🔥 1. ADMIN MUST HAVE FULL PERMISSIONS EVERYWHERE

Give the Admin role explicit access to:

View all establishments

View all tabs: Inventory, Equipment, Tasks, Weekly Tasks, Menu & Portion Sizes, Checklists, Employees

Add new inventory items

Add new equipment items

Add new tasks

Add new checklists

Add menu items and portion sizes

Edit and delete any item

Manage users

Admin must never see “no data” unless the data is truly empty.

🔥 2. ADMIN MUST SEE ALL EXISTING DATA

Right now the Admin sees zero items because:

The Admin is not linked to an establishment

Or the filters exclude Admin users

Fix this by applying:

Admin must ALWAYS be able to see:

All inventory items

All tasks

All checklists

All weekly tasks

All menu items

All portion sizes

All equipment issue categories

Regardless of establishment filters.

🔥 3. ADMIN MUST SEE ALL PENDING USERS

Fix the approval system so that:

When a user registers, the Admin is notified

The Admin can open a section (like “Pending Users”)

The Admin can approve, reject, and assign roles

Approval must work even if no Manager exists yet

Admin must always be able to approve the first Manager.

🔥 4. ADMIN MUST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO ASSIGN ROLES

Fix logic:

Admin can assign roles (Employee, Lead, Manager) to ANY user

Admin can promote someone to Manager so they can manage their employees

Admin must be able to manage all establishments

🔥 5. ADMIN ESTABLISHMENT VISIBILITY FIX

Currently the Admin may not be linked to any establishment.

Fix:

Admin must be “Global Access”

Admin can view all establishments

Admin is not restricted by the user’s establishment filter

Admin sees all users in all establishments

🔥 6. RESTORE PREVIOUS FUNCTIONALITY WHILE KEEPING ADMIN ACCESS

Bring back the previous system where:

Inventory items appeared normally

Weekly tasks appeared normally

Checklists appeared normally

Menu & Portion sizes appeared normally

But now ensure the Admin has access to ALL of them.

🔥 7. ENSURE TABS ARE NOT HIDDEN FROM ADMIN

If the builder hides tabs based on role permissions:

Make sure Admin is included in the role-permissions of EVERY tab.

Do not hide or restrict ANY operational tab from the Admin.

🔥 8. ADMIN MUST BE ABLE TO MANUALLY CREATE OR EDIT MANAGERS

Fix the interface so Admin can:

Open the Employees tab

See ALL users

Approve pending users

Assign roles

Promote a user to Manager

Create proper hierarchy

🔥 9. SIGN-IN FIX FOR ADMIN

Ensure that when the Admin logs in:

The correct role is loaded

Permissions are applied instantly

All tabs show real data

All management features are available
