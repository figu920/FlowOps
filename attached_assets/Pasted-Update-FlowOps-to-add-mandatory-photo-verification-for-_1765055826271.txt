Update FlowOps to add mandatory photo verification for all Weekly Tasks.
Whenever a user marks a Weekly Task as completed, the app must immediately open a photo capture window and require the user to take a picture as proof.
This photo must be saved inside the task history so Managers can review it later.

📸 1. PHOTO REQUIREMENT ON COMPLETION

Modify the Weekly Tasks system so that:

✔ When a user taps the checkbox to complete a task:

Do NOT complete it immediately

Instead, open a camera/photo upload window

Require the user to take a photo or upload one

After submitting the photo, mark the task as completed

Save timestamp + user + photo

✔ The task should NOT be able to be completed without a photo.

This prevents employees from checking tasks without actually doing them.

📝 2. STORE PHOTO INSIDE THE TASK ENTRY

Each completed Weekly Task must include:

Completion timestamp

Completed by (employee name)

Photo proof

Optional comment field (if you want to expand later)

The photo must be stored permanently inside FlowOps (not in the chat).

👤 3. ROLE PERMISSIONS
Employees & Leads

Can complete tasks

Must upload a photo every time

Cannot delete photos

Cannot edit photo proofs

Managers

Can view photo proofs of every completed Weekly Task

Can scroll through photos organized by:

Task name

Date

Employee

Can delete or archive tasks if needed

📁 4. PHOTO GALLERY INSIDE EACH TASK (MANAGER + LEAD VIEW)

Inside every Weekly Task, add a section:

Task Completion History

Each entry shows:

Photo thumbnail

Timestamp

User

Tap to view full-screen photo

Managers can see ALL history.
Leads can see history too, but only Managers can delete.

🕒 5. TIMELINE INTEGRATION

Every completed task with a photo must also log to the timeline:

Example:

“8:21 PM — Weekly Task completed: Clean vent #3. Completed by Bella. Photo proof attached.”

Managers should be able to tap the timeline entry to view the photo.

📱 6. REQUIRED UI CHANGES

Weekly Tasks must show a “photo required” logic

Camera window should open automatically

Task is only marked complete after taking/uploading a photo

Photo preview before submitting

Clear error if no photo is provided

🔒 7. SECURITY / STORAGE

Photos must be stored securely inside the task record

Only Managers and Leads may view the full gallery

Employees may only see their own photos (optional)

No photos sent to chat or external apps
