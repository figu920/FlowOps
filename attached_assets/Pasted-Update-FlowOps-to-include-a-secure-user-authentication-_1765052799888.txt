Update FlowOps to include a secure user authentication system and a full role-management structure so that only Managers can assign roles and add/remove employees. Users must NOT be able to change their own role under any circumstance.

🔐 1. SECURE LOGIN SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Add a Login & Password system with individual accounts for:

Managers

Leads

Employees

Each user MUST log in using:

Email or username

Password

Once logged in, the app displays the features allowed for their role only.

Users must NOT be able to:

Change their role

Access Manager-only features

Access add/edit/delete screens unless allowed

A user CANNOT mark themselves as Manager or Lead.

👤 2. MANAGER ACCOUNT CREATION (TOP PRIORITY)

The app must include:

ONE manager account per store (or multiple if needed, but created manually)

Manager account is the ONLY role that can:

✔ create new users
✔ assign roles
✔ promote or demote employees
✔ delete users
✔ reset passwords
✔ approve Leads

Managers must be created from outside the app or manually as the "root" role.

📁 3. NEW TAB: “Employees” (VISIBLE ONLY TO MANAGERS AND LEADS)

Add a new tab on the main menu:

Employees

Inside this screen:

Managers can:

Add new employees

Add new Leads

Add new Managers (optional)

Edit employee information

Assign or change user roles

Remove (deactivate) employees

Reset employee passwords

View full employee list

Leads can:

Add employees

Edit employee information

Assign tasks to employees

Cannot promote users to Lead or Manager

Cannot delete users

Employees:

Cannot see this tab

Cannot add/edit/delete users

Cannot view employee list

This page must include:

Employee name

Role (Manager / Lead / Employee)

Edit button (Manager only)

Delete/Deactivate button (Manager only)

📝 4. USER LIST & ROLE ASSIGNMENT SCREEN

When the manager taps “Add Employee” or “Edit Employee”, show a form:

ADD EMPLOYEE FORM:

Name

Email / Username

Password

Role dropdown → (Employee, Lead, Manager)

Save

IMPORTANT:

Only Managers may set a user as a Lead or Manager.

Leads can only add Employees (not Leads or Managers).

EDIT EMPLOYEE FORM:

Name

Email

Role (editable only by Manager)

Reset password (optional)

Save changes

🛠 6. LINK TO ASSIGNMENT FEATURES

Weekly Tasks and Checklists must now use the employee list from the Employees tab.

Meaning:

When creating a weekly task or checklist item:

Assign To: (dropdown generated from Employees tab)

Employees must automatically appear in:

Weekly Tasks assignment

Checklist assignment

Incident reports

Timeline logs

No hard-coded names.

🔒 7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

No one can change their own role.

No one can access Manager screens unless their login role = Manager.

No one can access Lead features unless role = Lead.

Users cannot access any part of the app without logging in first.

Passwords must be stored securely.

Only Manager can assign or revoke roles.
