Fix the following bugs in FlowOps to restore correct functionality and prevent accidental user deletion:

❗ BUG 1 — ACCEPTED USERS GET DELETED BY ACCIDENT WHEN TAPPED

Currently, when an Admin or Manager taps an approved user inside the Employees list,
the user is immediately deleted.
This is a critical error.

Fix it as follows:
✔ Tapping a user should open a User Details screen

Not delete them.

✔ Add clear options inside User Details:

“View Information”

“Edit Role” (Admin/Manager only)

“Reset Password” (Admin/Manager only)

“Deactivate User”

“Delete User”

✔ User deletion must require:

Tap “Delete User”

Show confirmation popup:
“Are you sure you want to delete this user? This action cannot be undone.”

Only after confirming, delete the user.

Users must NEVER be deleted automatically when tapped.

❗ BUG 2 — INVENTORY ADD BUTTON (“+”) IS MISSING

Previously, Admin and Manager could add new inventory items via a "+" button in the top-right.

Now the button is gone.

Fix:
✔ Restore the “+” button in Inventory Screen

Visible ONLY to Admin and Managers.

✔ When pressed, open “Add Inventory Item” form:

Item name

Item photo (optional)

Default status (OK / Low / Out)

Category (optional)

Employees should not see this button.

❗ BUG 3 — CANNOT ADD NEW EQUIPMENT ITEMS

The Equipment tab previously allowed adding new equipment types (e.g., Fryer, Grill, Dishwasher).

Now the function is not available.

Fix:
✔ Restore the “+ Add Equipment Item” button in Equipment tab

Visible to Admin & Managers only.

✔ Add form:

Equipment name

Photo (optional)

Default status

Notes field

Employees should only be able to report an issue, not add new equipment.

❗ BUG 4 — CANNOT ADD NEW MENU ITEMS OR PORTION SIZES

The Menu & Portion Sizes tab originally allowed Admin/Manager to:

Add new menu items

Add ingredients

Assign portion sizes

Edit quantities

Now this feature is disabled.

Fix:
✔ Restore the “+ Add Menu Item” button

Visible ONLY to Admin & Managers.

✔ When adding a menu item, Admin/Manager can:

Enter dish name

Add ingredient list

Define portion sizes

Choose unit (grams, ounces, cups, bowls, pieces, tablespoons)

✔ Also restore:

“+ Add Ingredient” inside each dish

Edit ingredient

Delete ingredient

Employees and Leads: View-only.

❗ BUG 5 — ADMIN PERMISSIONS NOT APPLIED CORRECTLY

Currently the Admin:

Cannot add items

Cannot edit items

Cannot access or manage operational data

This must be corrected.

Fix:
✔ Admin must have full access everywhere:

Add inventory items

Add equipment items

Add tasks

Add menu items

Add portion sizes

Edit/delete ANY item

Access ALL establishments

See ALL users

Approve ANY user

❗ BUG 6 — APPROVED USERS DISPLAY AS “EXISTING ACCOUNT” BUT HAVE NO ACCESS

This happens when the user object is created but not fully assigned with correct role or approval status.

Fix:
✔ Ensure that approving a user automatically:

Sets their status to Active

Assigns the selected role

Grants access immediately

Removes them from Pending list
