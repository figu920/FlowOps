SUMMARY (For the AI Builder)

Transform FlowOps into a fully functional, secure, role-based operational app for university dining establishments.
Replace demo login, add a real authentication system, add roles (Admin, Manager, Lead, Employee), create a complete Profile feature, a secure approval workflow, and ensure that all operational functions (Inventory, Equipment Issues, Tasks, Weekly Tasks w/ photo, Menu & Portion Sizes) work with correct permissions.
