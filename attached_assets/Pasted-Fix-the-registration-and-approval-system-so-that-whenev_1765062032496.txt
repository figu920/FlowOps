Fix the registration and approval system so that whenever a new user registers, the Admin account (username: angelglezz_ ) receives an automatic notification and can see the user inside a new “Pending Users” screen.
The Admin must be able to approve each user and assign their role (Employee, Lead, or Manager).
Additionally, restore full Admin permissions so the Admin can add inventory items, equipment items, tasks, checklists, menu items, and all other operational data.

🔔 1. NOTIFICATION TO ADMIN ON USER REGISTRATION

Whenever a new user completes registration:

The Admin must immediately receive:

An in-app notification

A badge indicator on the Admin home screen

A visible count showing how many users are waiting approval

Example notification:

“New user registration: [Full Name]. Tap to approve or assign role.”

Notifications must ONLY be sent to Admin users.

📋 2. ADD NEW TAB FOR ADMIN: “Pending Users” / “Requesting Users”

Add a new tab or section visible ONLY to Admin:

Pending Users

(or “Requesting Users”)

This screen must show:

List of all new, unapproved accounts

Full name

Username

Establishment they selected

Time registered

When the Admin taps a user:

Show options:

Approve

Reject

Assign Role:

Employee

Lead

Manager

After approval:

The user immediately gains access according to their role

They no longer appear in the Pending Users list

Managers should NOT receive these notifications unless you later want that.

👤 3. ADMIN MUST HAVE FULL PERMISSIONS RESTORED

Fix the Admin role so that it regains access to ALL operational features:

Admin must be able to:

Add inventory items

Edit inventory

Add equipment items

Add tasks

Add weekly tasks

Add checklists

Add menu items

Edit portion sizes

View all data in every tab regardless of establishment

Add employees (optional)

Ensure the Admin role is applied to ALL tab permission checks.

🧩 4. ADMIN ROLE MUST OVERRIDE ALL ESTABLISHMENT FILTERS

Fix the behavior where Admin sees empty lists:

Admin must bypass establishment filtering

Admin must see inventory, tasks, checklists, menu items, etc. even if they were created under another establishment

Admin must NOT be restricted by permission checks meant for Managers or Leads

👥 5. ALLOW ADMIN TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS FOR THEMSELVES

Add a feature allowing Admin to manually create new accounts under their control:

“Create New User” button inside the Admin panel.

Admin can:

Enter username

Email

Password

Establishment

Assign a role immediately

This is important because you want to create one additional account for yourself.

🔑 6. ROLE ASSIGNMENT REQUIRED BEFORE ACCESS

Fix the system so:

No user can access the app until the Admin assigns a role

Default role is NOT assigned automatically

Only Admin can give the first Manager role to someone

This ensures Managers cannot self-assign permissions.

🔐 7. ADMIN MUST SEE THEIR OWN ROLE & HAVE UNRESTRICTED ACCESS

Inside Admin profile:

Role: Admin (read-only)

Admin must ALWAYS have access to:

Pending Users tab

Employees tab

Inventory tab

Equipment tab

Tasks tab

Menu & Portions tab

Checklists tab

All operational data in every establishment
