Update FlowOps to replace the current “demo user/demo password” login with a full real user registration and approval system.
All users must be able to register with their own credentials, select their work location, and wait for Manager approval before accessing the app.
The system must include secure login, real user accounts, establishment selection, and Manager approval/role assignment.

🔐 1. REMOVE DEMO LOGIN COMPLETELY

Delete all demo users, fake credentials, or autogenerated accounts.

When the app loads, it must show:

Login screen (username + password)

Register button

No demo accounts.
No default passwords.
Real users only.

📝 2. REGISTRATION FORM (FOR ALL NEW USERS)

When a user taps “Register”, show a form with:

REGISTRATION FORM:

Full Name

Email

Username

Password

Confirm Password

Establishment (dropdown list)

Optional Phone Number

Establishment Dropdown MUST include:

Bison Den

(Allow the manager to add more establishments later)

After submitting the form:

✔ Account is created in “Pending Approval” status
✔ User CANNOT access the app yet
✔ User sees message: “Your account is pending approval from your Manager.”

👤 3. MANAGER APPROVAL SYSTEM (SUPER IMPORTANT)

In the Manager account, add a section:

User Approvals

Inside this screen, the manager sees a list of all new registrations:

Example:

Angel García — Bison Den — Pending

Kendra Brown — Bison Den — Pending

Marco Torres — Bison Den — Pending

For each user, the manager can:

Approve

Reject

Assign Role

AVAILABLE ROLES:

Employee

Lead

Manager (only if the current manager allows it)

Once approved, the user gets access immediately.

👥 4. ON APPROVAL, MANAGER MUST ASSIGN ROLE

When approving, the Manager must choose:

Employee (default)

Lead

Manager

Users cannot choose their own role.
Users cannot modify their role after approval.

🏢 5. ESTABLISHMENT SYSTEM (MULTIPLE LOCATIONS)

Each user MUST belong to one establishment.

Modify the app so:

Each establishment has its own employees

Each establishment has its own Manager account(s)

Managers can ONLY see users from their own establishment

Data separation is enforced per establishment

Example:

Bison Den users only appear to the Bison Den manager

Trailblazer Café users only appear to that manager

Etc.

This prepares FlowOps for scaling to multiple restaurants and universities.

👤 6. USER LIST (INSIDE MANAGER PANEL)

Add a tab visible ONLY to Managers:

Employees

This list must show:

User name

Role

Status (Active / Pending / Removed)

Establishment

Edit button

Remove/Deactivate button

Managers can:

Promote Employee → Lead

Promote Lead → Manager

Demote roles

Remove users

Reset passwords

Leads can:

ONLY view the employee list

NOT edit roles

NOT approve new users

NOT remove employees

Employees cannot see this tab at all.

🔑 7. LOGIN PERMISSIONS

After login:

Employees

Only access employee features

Never see Manager or Lead options

Leads

Access lead-level features (add inventory, assign tasks, etc.)

Cannot approve new users

Cannot assign roles

Managers

Full access

User approvals

Role management

Establishment management

🎯 8. USER EXPERIENCE AFTER REGISTRATION

If a user logs in BEFORE being approved:

Show message:

“Your registration is pending approval. Please wait for your Manager to approve your account.”

User cannot access anything until approved.

🛠 9. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Real passwords (minimum 8 characters)

Email or username required to log in

No role changes allowed by the user

Users cannot spoof establishments

All roles locked behind manager approval

All data stored securely

✔️ END OF PROMPT
