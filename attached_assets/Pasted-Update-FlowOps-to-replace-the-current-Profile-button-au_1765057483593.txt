Update FlowOps to replace the current “Profile button automatically signs out” behavior with a complete and professional Profile system.
Users must be able to view and edit their personal information without being logged out automatically.
Sign Out must only happen when the user intentionally taps the “Sign Out” button inside the Profile screen.

👤 1. CREATE A FULL “PROFILE” SCREEN

When the user taps the Profile icon, DO NOT sign out.
Instead open a new screen called:

My Profile

This screen must display:

Profile Picture (circular, editable)

Full Name

Username

Email

Role (Employee / Lead / Manager — read only)

Establishment (read only for employees; editable by Manager)

Under that, show a set of editable fields:

Editable Fields:

Change Profile Photo

Change Username

Change Email

Change Password

(Optional) Change Establishment (Manager approval only)

Managers may also have:

Manage Team shortcut

Approvals shortcut (optional)

🖼 2. PROFILE PHOTO FEATURE

Users must be able to:

Upload a photo

Use the camera to take a new photo

Replace or delete their current photo

The photo should be stored in their account and appear in chats, timeline logs, and employee lists.

✏️ 3. EDIT ACCOUNT INFORMATION

Inside the Profile screen, users must be able to:

Update their email

Update their username

Update their password

When editing password, require:

Old Password

New Password

Confirm Password

The app must save changes securely and update instantly.

🔒 4. ROLE PERMISSIONS FOR PROFILE
All Users (Employee, Lead, Manager)

Can edit profile photo

Can edit username

Can edit password

Can edit email

Employees & Leads

Cannot change their assigned role

Cannot change establishment

Cannot approve or manage other users

Managers

Can change establishment (if needed)

Can access “Employees” tab from profile

Cannot change their own role (for security)

🚪 5. ADD A PROPER “SIGN OUT” BUTTON

At the BOTTOM of the Profile screen, add:

Sign Out

(Styled as a separate button in red or neutral color)

Users must only sign out when they tap this button.

IMPORTANT:

Tapping profile must NEVER auto-sign out

Sign out must ONLY occur from the explicit button

🛠 6. REQUIRED UI BEHAVIOR

Profile screen opens normally (no logout)

Photo + fields appear in a clean, modern layout

Changes save instantly

After sign out, user returns to Login screen

Login stays persistent unless Sign Out is pressed

✔️ END OF PROMPT
